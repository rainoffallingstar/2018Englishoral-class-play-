##### **BACKGROUND**

>  In October 2017, **J** was transferred to the grade director. Meanwhile, students still live in the dream of the golden age, everything is like a good direction of development, but they did not notice the quiet haze in the sky. In the following days, the storm brought by J will sweep all innocent people and students, simultaneously played the final elegy for the golden age.

##### **THE FIRST SCENE CHILL**

**AT RISE:** In a rainy afternoon，the last class is over，at the door of the classroom，P and A enter.

**P**:Hey，Apollo，Are you going to the English class? By the way, we are working on a script named *a day of medical students.* Have you joined a team?

**A**: (*Pale and tired*) Ah? English script? What's going on here?

**P**: (*Smiling and wondering*) What? Did you forget it? The teacher arranged the homework a few weeks ago.

 **A**: (*Tired*) I…I seem remember it! Oh! What shall I do! I have already forgotten to set up a team! Are you still in need of people? Let me join you and go through the motions.

**P**: That’s why we came to find you, (*Doubtfully*),what’s wrong with you? You don't look very well, are you sick?

**A**：No, maybe I didn't sleep well last night. Yesterday, at midnight, my roommate was playing games, it was really too noisy to sleep (*Sighing*) So I got up to listen to Professor Zeus's Biochemistry class, and I almost fell asleep.

 **P**: Ha ha ha, I see. My roommate also played video games yesterday. It is a little hard to study all the time, just play games and relax sometimes...... I think the Biochemistry teacher’s teaching is not bad. But, well, he said that we would have a test soon this morning......If you think his class is boring, you can talk to him next time.  

 **A**：I have thought about it for several times. I wanted to have a talk with him during the break time, but I saw Minerva asking questions very carefully every time. Therefore I gave up…. (*Laughing*)  

(*At this time**，***M *enters*)

**M**：(*Happily*)Hello，A,P，What are you talking about so happily?

**P**：I just invited A into our team successfully!

**M**：That's awesome. In this way, we have a complete team to compete with L's team. I can't wait to defeat him.

**A**: Ha ha ha. Hearing you say so, is there any enmity between you two?

**M**：That’s not. By the way, my dormitory was really checked by him and his following yesterday. And it turned out to be a D-class dormitory. It's really miserable, but how can I blame others?

**A&P**: We feel really sorry for you.

(*The three characters step down from the stage or platform*)

##### **THE SECOND SCENE AFFECTIONATE**

(*In a gloomy afternoon**，**an* *empty classroom**，***A*，B，M，***P** *enter*)

**P**：Is everyone here? (*Distributing the scripts in hand to everyone*) Let's take a look at the script we wrote before. The teacher said that we were going to give a performance in the next week, there is not enough time for us. Let’s have a rehearsal first......

 **M**: (*Making complaints suddenly*) I suddenly find that I spent more time on English than in my professional subjects! There’s no way, let’s rehearse it quickly. I have to go to the classroom and review my Physiology.......

**B**: Don’t worry. (*Laughing*)Aren't we doing this every day?

**A**：(*Looking down at the script.*) Are you sure my role is so miserable? Just see that…..How it could be that the person’s bicycle broke down on the way to classroom, and be caught by the counselor when taking out the phone to know the present time in the same day…

**B**: You still don't know what's worse behind? P wrote him to eat worms in the cafeteria for lunch. And......it seems that the water suddenly stopped when he was washing his hair? Did you? (*Doubtfully asking P*)

**P**: Yeah. I thought about writing this before. But I have no idea how to arrange this plot. Did the engineering team break up the pipes again? It’s really a stereotype, I don't think the audiences will like it.......

**A**: But why not write something romantic? Such as love or something. Love is the eternal theme of literary works, you know?

**M**：Have it been arranged in my role already? However, it seems to be creating a playboy image.

**A**：emmm，wait for a minute. Let me see your dialogues.... (*Performing*) Oh! My brother! When I meet the person I love secretly, I will take off my medal and exchange my gold for a thick book for her....... (*Stop and return to be normal*)Man! This paragraph is especially Shakespeare's style.

 **P**：This is a dreamlike scene! Don't think so much, guys, time is money, let’s find somewhere to have rehearse! Cherish the good old days!

(*The four characters step down from the stage or platform*.)

##### *Epilogue*

> In November 2017, **J** carried out a major shuffle. In the month, everybody were shocked and nervous. The real farces in history were often more real, cruel and changeable than the virtual ones.
